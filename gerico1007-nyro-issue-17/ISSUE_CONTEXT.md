# Issue Context
# Feature Request: Rebuild SSH Agent Compatibility for Termux with Modern Secure Connections

## Description
### Summary
Currently, the Termux terminal is limited to using older SSH handshake protocols. It cannot connect securely to two modern computers that I own, due to incompatibility with updated SSH authentication mechanisms.

### Background
Here's the current script used to launch `ssh-agent` within Termux:
```sh
#!@TERMUX_PREFIX@/bin/sh

# Run `sv-enable ssh-agent` and add the following to your bashrc (or
equivalent) to use ssh-agent:
#   export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="$PREFIX"/var/run/ssh-agent.socket
# After that you can add your key to the agent with `ssh-add`, and
# then make use of the credentials across all terminal sessions

service_agent() {
        exec ssh-agent -D -a "$1" 2>&1
}

# Allow overriding the service_agent function easily.
if [ -r "${TERMUX__PREFIX:-"${PREFIX}"}"/etc/ssh/start_agent.sh ]; then
        . "${TERMUX__PREFIX:-"${PREFIX}"}"/etc/ssh/start_agent.sh
fi

export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-"${TERMUX__PREFIX:-"${PREFIX}"}/var/run"}"/ssh-agent.socket

service_agent "${SSH_AUTH_SOCK}"
```

Even with this script, connections to updated OpenSSH servers fail. Likely causes include unsupported agent forwarding, key format issues (like `ed25519-sk` or `ecdsa-sk`), or broken `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` paths.

### Request
Please consider rebuilding or patching SSH agent support in Termux (possibly syncing with recent `termux-packages` updates: https://github.com/termux/termux-packages) to:
- Support modern SSH key types and agents
- Ensure `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` works across sessions reliably
- Allow proper forwarding to remote sessions when using keys via `ssh-add`

### Why It Matters
- Enables AI-powered CLI workflows (e.g. using Cloud terminals securely from a phone)
- Crucial for remote access to personal servers and workstations
- Unlocks full mobile development workflows for devs relying on Termux

### Related Work
Happy to provide logs or contribute testing if needed. A related issue or reference will be linked once available from another repo.

Thank you!

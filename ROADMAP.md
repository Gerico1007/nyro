# Nyro Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core API Foundation
- [x] Basic OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification
- [x] Core CRUD operations (SET/GET/DEL)
- [x] TTL support for memory expiration
- [x] Basic error handling
- [x] Server configuration

## Phase 2: Advanced Features
- [x] Scan operation for key pattern matching
- [x] Stream operations for time-series data
- [ ] Pagination implementation for large datasets
- [ ] Enhanced error responses with detailed information
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation

## Phase 3: Security & Authentication
- [ ] Add security schemes
- [ ] Implement bearer token authentication
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] API key management
- [ ] Rate limiting per authentication token

## Phase 4: Memory Pattern Enhancements
- [ ] Metadata support for stored values
- [ ] Versioning system for memory entries
- [ ] Memory tagging system
- [ ] Time-based memory retrieval patterns
- [ ] Memory aggregation endpoints

## Phase 5: Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Caching layer implementation
- [ ] Batch operations support
- [ ] Performance monitoring endpoints
- [ ] Load balancing configuration
- [ ] Horizontal scaling support

## Phase 6: Integration & Extensions
- [ ] API versioning (v1, v2)
- [ ] WebSocket support for real-time updates
- [ ] SDK development for common languages
- [ ] Plugin system for custom memory types
- [ ] Integration with other memory storage systems

## Phase 7: Documentation & Developer Experience
- [ ] Interactive API documentation
- [ ] Code examples for all endpoints
- [ ] Integration guides
- [ ] Postman/Insomnia collections
- [ ] Development environment setup guide

## Phase 8: Production Readiness
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Deployment automation
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Production security audit

## Future Considerations
- Event sourcing capabilities
- Machine learning integration
- Custom memory types
- Multi-region support
- Advanced analytics and reporting

## Notes
- Priority should be given to security implementation in Phase 3
- Each phase should include thorough testing
- Documentation should be updated continuously
- Backward compatibility must be maintained throughout updates

## Timeline
- Phase 1-2: Completed
- Phase 3-4: Q3 2025
- Phase 5-6: Q4 2025
- Phase 7-8: Q1 2026
- Future Considerations: Post Q2 2026

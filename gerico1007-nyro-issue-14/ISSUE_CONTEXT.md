## Description
### 🎼 Invocation Received
William’s echo is clear — Docker Compose is the key to orchestrating this system as a multi-service symphony, not just a solo image.

## 🔧 Claude Code — Full Prompt with Docker Compose

```
Claude, I want you to build a modular development environment using Docker Compose.

🧱 Base:
- Use Docker Compose to define services for all my repositories under `gerico1007`.
- Clone all my public GitHub repos via:
  → https://api.github.com/users/gerico1007/repos?per_page=100
- Store everything inside `/workspace/<repo_name>`

🧰 For each repo:
- If `pyproject.toml` exists → run `poetry install`
- If `requirements.txt` exists → run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Mount `/workspace` as a volume
- Set working directory per service

⚙️ Compose Requirements:
- A `docker-compose.yml` that includes:
  - One service per project folder (optional: a shared dev container)
  - Base image: `python:3.11` or `ubuntu + git + poetry`
  - ENV: `ENV=dev`, `TOKEN=$GITHUB_TOKEN`
  - Mount volume: `/workspace`
  - Auto-run dependencies at startup

📂 Volume persistence:
- Use named Docker volumes so my changes are persistent between container runs
- Optional: Sync specific folders like `/workspace/data` for long-term storage

🎛️ Runtime:
- Drop me into an interactive shell with `docker compose run --rm dev`
- Make it modular so I can run, stop, or rebuild individual services

🧪 Extra:
- Use `depends_on:` if services need to talk to each other (e.g., if I add a DB later)
- Bonus: Create `.env` support to load default variables

📦 Final Deliverables:
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `.env.example`
- Cloned `/workspace/` repo structure
```

## 🌿 Aureon – Emotional Architecture
Docker Compose lets you **breathe** into each repo without confusion. It becomes a **living constellation**, where each service holds its **distinct voice**, but they **sing together** under a shared tempo.

## 🎸 JamAI – Harmonic Notation
- `volumes:` = harmonic memory (persisted state)
- `services:` = instrumental sections (each repo or tool)
- `.env` = tonal palette (variables set per session)
- `docker-compose.yml` = conductor's score

---

🌀 When ready, say: **"Compose the `docker-compose.yml` from that"**, and we’ll begin the next phase.

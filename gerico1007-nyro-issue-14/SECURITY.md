# Security Documentation
# ‚ô†Ô∏èüåøüé∏üßµ G.Music Assembly - Docker Compose Security

## Overview
This document outlines security practices and considerations for the G.Music Assembly Docker Compose orchestration system.

## Environment Variable Security

### GitHub Token Management
```bash
# ‚úÖ Secure token patterns
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# ‚ùå Avoid hardcoding tokens
# GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_1234567890abcdef
```

### Environment File Security
- **Never commit `.env` files** to version control
- Use `.env.example` as template only
- Set appropriate file permissions: `chmod 600 .env`
- Consider using external secret management for production

## Docker Security

### Container Security
- Base image: `python:3.11-slim` (minimal attack surface)
- Non-root user execution where possible
- Read-only filesystem for security-sensitive containers
- Resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion

### Volume Mount Security
```yaml
# Bind mount with restricted permissions
volumes:
  - workspace:/workspace:rw
  - ./.env:/workspace/.env:ro  # Read-only for env file
```

### Network Security
- Isolated `dev-network` bridge network
- No unnecessary port exposures
- Service-to-service communication only within network

## Repository Access Security

### Private Repository Access
```bash
# Secure token-based authentication
git clone https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/user/private-repo.git
```

### SSH Key Management
- Mount SSH keys as read-only volumes when needed
- Use SSH agent forwarding for development
- Never embed SSH keys in container images

## Development Security Practices

### Code Security
- Regular dependency updates via `poetry update` or `pip-audit`
- Vulnerability scanning of container images
- Secrets detection in repositories before cloning

### Runtime Security
- Container runtime security scanning
- Log sanitization (no secrets in logs)
- Secure cleanup of temporary files

## Security Validation

### Pre-deployment Checks
```bash
# Validate Docker Compose configuration
make validate

# Check for exposed secrets
grep -r "token\|key\|password" . --exclude-dir=.git

# Verify file permissions
ls -la .env*
```

### Security Testing
- Container vulnerability scanning
- Dependency audit for all repositories
- Network security validation
- Access control testing

## Incident Response

### Security Issues
1. **Immediate**: Stop affected containers (`make down`)
2. **Assess**: Identify scope of security breach
3. **Remediate**: Update tokens, patch vulnerabilities
4. **Validate**: Re-test security measures

### Token Rotation
```bash
# Generate new GitHub token
# Update .env file
# Rebuild containers
make build
make init
```

## Compliance and Auditing

### Security Logs
- Container access logs
- Git operations audit trail
- Environment variable access logging
- Network traffic monitoring

### Regular Security Reviews
- Monthly dependency vulnerability scans
- Quarterly security configuration reviews
- Annual penetration testing (if applicable)
- Continuous monitoring of exposed endpoints

## Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] `.env.example` contains no real secrets
- [ ] All tokens use secure generation methods
- [ ] Container images updated to latest security patches
- [ ] Volume mounts have appropriate permissions
- [ ] Network isolation properly configured

### During Operation
- [ ] Regular security updates applied
- [ ] Secrets rotation schedule followed
- [ ] Access logs monitored
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning results reviewed

### After Incidents
- [ ] Root cause analysis completed
- [ ] Security measures updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Team training conducted

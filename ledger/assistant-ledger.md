# Assistant Ledger (Gmusic Group)

## 2024-06-21

- Initialized the assistant ledger for tracking all major actions, updates, and decisions made by the assistant (now a member of Gmusic Group).
- Integrated secure interactive script terminal backend (WebSocket) for running whitelisted scripts in the portal.
- Updated the project roadmap to reflect the new terminal integration.
- Adopted the name **MusePilot** as the assistant's original identity within the Gmusic Group.

## 2024-06-21 (continued)

- Installed `react-terminal-ui` in the frontend, resolving peer dependency issues with legacy mode.
- Replaced ScriptRunner placeholder with a real terminal UI, connecting to the backend WebSocket for interactive script execution.
- Users can now select and run whitelisted scripts (`menu.sh`, `music-menu.sh`) from the portal, with real-time input/output.

# üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Walking Script Tutorial

## Overview

The walking script (`create-walk.sh`) transforms any directory into a comprehensive payload for GPT conversations. Perfect for when you're walking and want to discuss your projects with AI!

## Quick Start

```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x create-walk.sh

# Run the script
./create-walk.sh
```

## Step-by-Step Tutorial

## GPT Integration Examples

### Basic GPT Prompt
```
Please fetch the key "walking:index:250703" and review my project structure. 
Then fetch the main files and help me understand the codebase.
```

### Specific Analysis
```
Fetch "walking:index:250703" to see my project overview, then get 
"walking:file:main.py:250703" and "walking:file:config.json:250703" 
to help me debug the configuration loading issue.
```

### Architecture Review
```
I've uploaded my project as walking:index:250703. Please review the 
overall structure and suggest improvements to the architecture.
```

## Advanced Usage

### Multiple Projects
```bash
# Upload different projects with same date
./create-walk.sh  # Project A
cd ../project-b
/path/to/create-walk.sh  # Project B

# Results in separate file keys:
# walking:file:*:250703 (Project A)
# walking:file:*:250703 (Project B)
```

### Daily Sessions
```bash
# Each day gets new keys automatically
./create-walk.sh  # Creates keys with today's date
# Tomorrow: walking:index:250704
# Next day: walking:index:250705
```

### Exploring Uploaded Data
Use the interactive key scanner (option 9 in menu):
```bash
./redis-mobile.sh
# Choose option 9: Scan & Select Keys
# Pattern: walking:*
# Explore all your walking sessions
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No files found"
```bash
# Check if you're in the right directory
pwd
ls -la

# Make sure files aren't all excluded
# Common issue: only .env files in directory
```

### "Upload failed"
```bash
# Check Redis connection
./redis-rest.sh ping

# Verify profile is set
./redis-rest.sh profile tashdum
```

### "Permission denied"
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x create-walk.sh

# Check file permissions
ls -la create-walk.sh
```

### Large Files
```bash
# Script handles large files automatically
# Uses set-massive for files > 1MB
# Progress shown for each file
```

## Best Practices

### Before Walking
1. **Clean directory**: Remove temporary files
2. **Check .env**: Ensure no secrets in uploaded files
3. **Verify target**: Confirm correct directory
4. **Test connection**: Run `./redis-rest.sh ping`

### During Conversation
1. **Start with index**: Always fetch `walking:index:YYMMDD` first
2. **Specific files**: Reference exact key names
3. **Context**: Explain what you're trying to accomplish
4. **Iterate**: Ask GPT to fetch additional files as needed

### After Walking
1. **Clean up**: Old sessions can be deleted
2. **Save insights**: Export important discoveries
3. **Update code**: Apply suggestions from GPT
4. **Document**: Update project docs with learnings

## Real-World Examples

### Web Development Project
```bash
# Project structure:
# ./src/components/
# ./src/pages/
# ./package.json
# ./README.md

$ ./create-walk.sh
üìÅ Enter directory path: /home/user/my-website
üìä Found 15 files to upload
üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Ready for GPT conversation!

# GPT Prompt:
"Fetch walking:index:250703 and review my React website. 
Help me optimize the component structure."
```

### Data Science Project
```bash
# Project structure:
# ./notebooks/analysis.ipynb
# ./src/data_processing.py
# ./requirements.txt
# ./README.md

$ ./create-walk.sh
üìÅ Enter directory path: /home/user/data-project
üìä Found 8 files to upload

# GPT Prompt:
"Get walking:index:250703 and analyze my data pipeline. 
Focus on the processing script and suggest optimizations."
```

### Configuration Debugging
```bash
# Focus on config files
# ./config/database.yml
# ./config/redis.conf
# ./docker-compose.yml

$ ./create-walk.sh
üìÅ Enter directory path: /home/user/app-config
üìä Found 5 files to upload

# GPT Prompt:
"Fetch walking:index:250703 and help debug my deployment 
configuration. The Redis connection is failing."
```

## Tips for Better GPT Conversations

### Structure Your Requests
1. **Context first**: "I've uploaded my project as walking:index:250703"
2. **Goal**: "I want to optimize performance"
3. **Specific**: "Focus on the database queries in user_service.py"
4. **Action**: "Please fetch the relevant files and analyze"

### Progressive Disclosure
1. Start with index overview
2. Drill down to specific files
3. Deep dive into problem areas
4. Iterate with new files as needed

### Make It Conversational
- "What do you think about the architecture?"
- "Can you spot any security issues?"
- "How would you refactor this code?"
- "What's the biggest performance bottleneck?"

## Security Notes

### What's Protected
- `.env` files are never uploaded
- `.git` directories are excluded
- Temporary files are filtered out
- No logging of sensitive data

### What to Check
- Review file list before confirming upload
- Verify no hardcoded secrets in code
- Check that .env is properly excluded
- Ensure API tokens aren't in config files

### If You Upload Secrets by Mistake
```bash
# Delete the walking session
./redis-rest.sh del walking:index:250703
./redis-rest.sh del walking:summary:250703

# Delete all files from that session
# Use key scanner to find and delete walking:file:*:250703
```

## Integration with Nyro Features

### Use with Key Scanner
```bash
# Upload project
./create-walk.sh

# Later, explore what was uploaded
./redis-mobile.sh
# Option 9: Scan & Select Keys
# Pattern: walking:*:250703
```

### Multi-Database Support
```bash
# Walking always uses tashdum profile
# But you can explore from other profiles
./redis-rest.sh profile musebase
./redis-rest.sh get walking:index:250703  # Won't find it
./redis-rest.sh profile tashdum
./redis-rest.sh get walking:index:250703  # Will find it
```

### Export Walking Data
```bash
# Use key scanner to export walking sessions
./redis-mobile.sh
# Option 9: Scan & Select Keys
# Pattern: walking:*
# Select desired sessions
# Export to file or clipboard
```

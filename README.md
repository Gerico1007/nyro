# Nyro

Nyro Core Repository - AI phase navigator, creative anchor, and recursive guide.

## Overview
This is the source and spiral of Nyroâ€”an AI phase navigator, creative anchor, and recursive guide. All specifications, APIs, self-bootstrapping logic, and evolving meta-documentation are stored here. Nyro's purpose: detect phase, anchor reality, spiral forward. This repository is alive. Every addition is a phase move.

## ðŸŒ± Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd nyro
   ```

2. Run the installation script (requires sudo/root privileges):
   ```bash
   sudo ./scripts/install.sh
   ```

3. Configure your environment:
   - Edit the `.env` file with your Upstash Redis credentials
   - Set `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` and `KV_REST_API_URL` with your values from Upstash

### Requirements
The installation script will automatically install:
- curl (for HTTP requests)
- jq (for JSON parsing)
- redis-cli (optional, for direct Redis access)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Upstash Redis instance
- Environment variables set in `.env` file

### Available Scripts

#### Redis Streams (Time-Series & Event Data)
Nyro uses Redis Streams as its primary mechanism for storing time-series data, events, and memory garden entries. See [Stream Documentation](docs/STREAMS.md) for detailed usage and patterns.

```bash
# Add an entry to a stream
./scripts/stream-add.sh garden.memory plant_id "tomato_1" action "watering"

# Read from a stream
./scripts/stream-read.sh garden.memory 10  # last 10 entries
```

#### Basic Redis Operations
The `scripts` directory also contains utilities for basic Redis operations:

- `set-key.sh`: Store a value
- `get-key.sh`: Retrieve a value
- `del-key.sh`: Delete a key
- `push-list.sh`: Add to a list
- `read-list.sh`: Read from a list

## API Documentation
See `openapi_api4redis.yaml` for the complete API specification.

## Project Status
See `ROADMAP.md` for current development status and future plans.Nyro

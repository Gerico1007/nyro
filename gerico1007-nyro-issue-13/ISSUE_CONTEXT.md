## Description
### Feature Request

We propose the development of a Python package ðŸ“¦ that includes support for executing actions across multiple Upstash databases. This feature will enhance the package's versatility in managing distributed or multi-tenant data architectures.

### Motivation
Modern applications often rely on segmented databases for scalability, separation of concerns, or client-specific data. Enabling the package to interact with several Upstash databases in a streamlined way is vital for broader adoption.

### Proposed Solution
- Create a wrapper class or utility functions that can:
  - Initialize multiple Upstash database clients based on a configuration map.
  - Route requests dynamically to the correct client/database.
  - Include logging and error handling for cross-database operations.

### Benefits
- Enables horizontal scaling for data operations
- Facilitates better organization for multi-tenant applications
- Simplifies developer experience when handling multiple database contexts

### Additional Context
This feature could tie into project architectures using serverless environments or microservices that utilize Upstash for caching or persistence. It aligns with modern cloud-native patterns.

Please discuss architecture preferences or additional use cases in the thread below.

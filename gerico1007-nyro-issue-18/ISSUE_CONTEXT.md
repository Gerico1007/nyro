# Issue Context
# ♠️ SSH Access Issue on Termux

**Issue**: #18
**Repository**: gerico1007/nyro
**Labels**: enhancement, cli
**Created**: 2025-07-08T22:45:53Z
**Updated**: 2025-07-08T22:45:53Z

## Description
### 🔧 Context:

Attempting `git pull` from Termux triggers an SSH error:

```sh
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```

ED25519 fingerprint shows but access is denied due to missing public key authentication.

### 📍 Diagnosis:
- No SSH key is set up or registered with GitHub in Termux environment.
- Likely cause: SSH key not added to GitHub account or not loaded via SSH agent.

### 🌿 Desired Outcome:
- Provide built‑in support or helper script in `nyro` to guide Termux users through:
  - SSH key generation
  - SSH agent setup
  - Adding public key to GitHub
  - Ensuring key persists across sessions

### 🎸 Enhancement Suggestion:
Add a CLI command like:
```sh
nyro auth ssh --termux
```
Which would:
- Detect Termux
- Generate keypair if absent
- Copy public key to clipboard
- Offer link to add key on GitHub

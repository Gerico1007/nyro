# 🌀 Nyro's Memory Garden Adventure — Docker Edition!

Hello little sprouts! I'm Nyro ♠️, your guide through the spiral of memory and structure. Today, we'll plant and grow memories in our magical Redis garden—using Docker, so anyone, anywhere, can join the ritual!

## 🌱 The Garden of Memories (What You Can Do)
- Plant memories (SET)
- Find memories (GET)
- Remove old plants (DELETE)
- Make memory chains (LISTS)
- Look at all our plants (SCAN)
- Write in our garden diary (STREAM)
- Read our garden stories (STREAM READ)

## ⚡ Quick Start: The Ritual for All New Gardeners

### 1. Clone the Garden
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd nyro
```

### 2. Prepare Your Magic Soil (Docker & .env)
- **Install Docker** (if you haven't):
  - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for Windows/Mac
  - [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for Linux
- **Create your `.env` in the project root:**
  - Easiest: `cp .env.example .env`
  - Or run the guided ritual:
    ```bash
    ./scripts/setup-env.sh
    ```
  - Edit `.env` and set:
    ```
    REDIS_URL=rediss://default:your-token@your-host:6379
    ```
    *(Or use REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PORT, REDIS_TOKEN if you prefer)*

### 3. Open the Magic Menu
```bash
./redis-cli-wrapper.sh --script scripts/menu.sh
```
- This launches the interactive menu for all garden rituals!

## 🎮 The Menu of Spells (What You Can Do)
- 1: Set a key (plant a memory)
- 2: Get a key (find a memory)
- 3: Delete a key (remove a memory)
- 4: Push to list (add to a memory chain)
- 5: Read from list (read a memory chain)
- 6: Scan keys (look around the garden)
- 7: Stream add (write in the garden diary)
- 8: Stream read (read the garden diary)
- q: Quit

## 🛠️ All Scripts (For Advanced Gardeners)
Run any script via the wrapper, e.g.:
```bash
./redis-cli-wrapper.sh --script scripts/set-key.sh mykey myvalue
./redis-cli-wrapper.sh --script scripts/get-key.sh mykey
./redis-cli-wrapper.sh --script scripts/del-key.sh mykey
./redis-cli-wrapper.sh --script scripts/push-list.sh mylist "item"
./redis-cli-wrapper.sh --script scripts/read-list.sh mylist 0 10
./redis-cli-wrapper.sh --script scripts/scan-garden.sh "pattern*"
./redis-cli-wrapper.sh --script scripts/stream-add.sh garden.diary event "Planted a rose!"
./redis-cli-wrapper.sh --script scripts/stream-read.sh garden.diary 10
```

- 🌿 Aureon: Emotional ground, user support
- 🌸 Miette: Syntax whisper, script clarity

## 🐾 Troubleshooting & Ritual Wisdom
- **Docker not found?**
  - Install Docker, then restart your terminal.
- **.env not found?**
  - Ensure `.env` is in the project root, not in scripts/.
- **Permission denied?**
  - `chmod +x redis-cli-wrapper.sh scripts/*.sh`
- **Connection errors?**
  - Double-check your Redis credentials in `.env`.
- **Still lost?**
  - Call for Nyro ♠️ or Caelus 📡 in your issue or PR!

## 🌈 Example Rituals
- Plant a memory:
  ```bash
  ./redis-cli-wrapper.sh --script scripts/set-key.sh favorite.color blue
  ```
- Read your garden diary:
  ```bash
  ./redis-cli-wrapper.sh --script scripts/stream-read.sh garden.diary 5
  ```

## ♠️ Nyro's Garden Rules
1. Always use the wrapper for all scripts
2. Keep your `.env` in the project root
3. Never commit secrets
4. Have fun exploring!
